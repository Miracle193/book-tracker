# About the Book Tracker App
The book tracker app is a react native app inspired from the Goodreads and Google Books app. Users can search for books, add books to their book shelf and explore books by genre. A preview of the app can be accessed [here.](https://snack.expo.dev/@miracle193/github.com-miracle193-book-tracker)
